1)   AI (typically trained on hundreds of thousands of examples from one canonical dataset) must generalize to new populations and devices without a substantial loss of performance, and without prohibitive data requirements for retraining. 
2)  AI tools must be applicable to real-world scans, problems and pathways, and designed for clinical evaluation and deployment 
3)  AI tools must match or exceed the performance of human experts in such real-world situations.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
